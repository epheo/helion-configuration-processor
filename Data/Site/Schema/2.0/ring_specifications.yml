                                     The ec-num-data-fragments and ec-num-parity-fragments
                                     attributes are used to control the level of redundancy
                                     and availability of objects in this ring. The values are
                                     significant to the ec-type in use. For "jerasure_rs_vand"
                                     an object is stored in ec-num-data-fragments fragments.
                                     An additional ec-num-parity-fragments parity fragments are
                                     also stored.

                                     For example, where ec-num-data-fragments is 10 and
                                     ec-num-parity-fragments parity is 4, at total of 14
                                     fragments are stored -- this is commonly represented as
                                     (14,10). To GET an object, any 10 fragments must be available
                                     in order to reconstruct the object. In space terms, the total
                                     size of the fragments is 1.4 times the size of the original
                                     object.

                                     To chose appropriate values for ec-num-data-fragments and
                                     ec-num-parity-fragments you must balance storage overhead with your
                                     availability requirements. For example, if you use (14,10) and have
                                     two swift-zones in the system, if all servers in a zone are
                                     down, only 7 fragments are available in the remaining zone.
                                     This is not enough to reconstruct your data and all GET
                                     operations will fail.
